# Moon-Phase-App

A "simple" app to request a specific moon phase by date and other parameters to show how it looks

### Get-Started

```Powershell
> dotnet restore
> dotnet build
> dotnet ".\bin\Debug\net9.0\win-x64\MoonPhaseApp.dll"
```

When first run it will prompt for a App ID and Secret.
To get them, go to [docs.astronomyapi.com]("https://docs.astronomyapi.com/") and follow the `Get Started` section

Happy Coding!
